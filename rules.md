# Rules

### I. **No spam or flooding.**

This includes posting offtopic memes, chain messages and bot commands such as ,poggit. Use #commands for bot commands.

### II. **No NSFW or inappropriate content.**

This server should be a comfortable environment for everyone, not just adolescents. Swearing is allowed provided it is not excessive or hostile.

### III. **Do not harass, insult or troll users.**

This server does not tolerate personal dramas (e.g. accusations of scammers). Do not ping someone unless your problem needs that user's personal attention. If you have a problem or question, ask it and wait for a response patiently.

### **IV. Advertisements may only be placed in advertisement.**

Unsolicited advertising is strictly disallowed.

### V. **English only.**

English is the shared language of most people here, and it's also the common language of our moderators.

### **VI. Do not post the same message or topic in multiple channels**

This will not help you get your question answered, but it will cause unnecessary annoyance to users. This also includes things like going to #earth-chat and writing "help me in **#**support please".

### VII. Be kind and polite

We are all here to create a welcoming environment. Please respect everyone. Healthy arguments are natural, but kindness is also required.
